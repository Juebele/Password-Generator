# Password-Generator
Password generator for challenge 3

This should give a password that matches the user's inputs. It will also throw up an error if the password length is not between 8 and 128 characters.

The user's choices do not reset automatically though; once a unit type is selected, it is true until the user refreshes the page so if you want to make multiple passwords with different character types you would need to refresh every time.
